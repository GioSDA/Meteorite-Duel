# GioSDA's Duel Plugin

This plugin was initially made for a server called MeteoritePVP, however that server is now defunct so I am releasing the plugin's source code for anyone to use.

## Features:
- Allows users to duel via a /duel command
- Duels have many settings and kits to cycle through (Some settings may not work depending on plugins)
- Fully customizable text
- Duel rewards and wagering via a GUI
- Duels can be spectated by anyone using /duel spectate
- Maps can be added via config

This plugin is not being maintained.
